# Adobe's OpenPBR BSDF

A self-contained, portable implementation of the [OpenPBR 1.0](https://openpbr.org/) BSDF, extracted from Adobe's proprietary renderer, Eclair. Written in a GLSL-style language with macros that target C++, GLSL, CUDA, MSL (Metal Shading Language), or Slang, it's designed to drop into any path tracer with minimal setup.

---

## Overview

OpenPBR is an "uber-shader" specification that merges [Adobe Standard Material](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-general/adobe-standard-material.html) and [Autodesk Standard Surface](https://autodesk.github.io/standard-surface/) into a single, physically plausible framework. We implement it as a fixed set of nested lobe classes (e.g., fuzz, coat), all sharing the same interface:

- **Evaluate** the BSDF
- **Sample** the BSDF
- **Compute** the PDF

In addition to those three core functions, the prepared BSDF exposes a single unified volume that consolidates all volumetric contributions from the full OpenPBR parameter set into one set of low-level properties. Volume integration itself is left entirely to the host renderer.

---

## Why Open Source?

OpenPBR is a powerful but complex material model — implementing it well from scratch requires deep rendering knowledge and a lot of time. We're open-sourcing this to lower that barrier: even a simple path tracer can integrate this production-grade implementation of the full OpenPBR 1.0 parameter set. This is the same code that ships in Eclair today, not a prototype or sample, and we hope it helps teams across the ecosystem adopt OpenPBR faster and validate their own integrations against a real-world reference. The code is released under Apache 2.0.

Note: This is shared as a reference implementation, not run as a community-driven open-source project. Because this code lives in a shipping product, we can't commit to a formal external review process. Pull requests, bug reports, and feature requests are all welcome, and we'll address them on a best-effort basis as our priorities allow. We can't promise to address every item, and large or invasive changes are unlikely to be accepted.

## Key Features

- **Single-include API:** `#include "openpbr.h"` brings in the complete public API — all types, settings, and the full BSDF.
- **Multi-language support:** C++, GLSL, CUDA, MSL, or Slang from the same source via a thin interop layer.
- **Self-contained:** No globals, no hidden dependencies – everything lives alongside the BSDF.
- **Configurable:** Compile-time settings in `openpbr_settings.h` control LUT mode, energy table storage type, fast math, and custom interop.
- **Fixed-lobe architecture:** One class per material component.
- **Energy-conserving:** The BSDF is designed to be energy-conserving for most common configurations, using precomputed LUTs for multiple-scattering compensation.
- **Reciprocal:** The BSDF satisfies Helmholtz reciprocity for most configurations. See [Path Tracing Direction](#path-tracing-direction) for the exception with transmission. (Note that reciprocity may be traded for better energy conservation in future versions.)

1. **Resolved Inputs**
   - `OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs` – A struct containing all official OpenPBR parameters after texture evaluation (`base_color`, `specular_roughness`, etc.), plus a few extra properties specific to this implementation.
   - `openpbr_make_default_resolved_inputs()` – Creates an `OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs` with default parameter values from the OpenPBR specification.

2. **Initialization**

   Main entry point (initializes both volume and BSDF lobes):
   - `openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume()` → Returns `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf` containing the volume and all BSDF lobes ready for evaluation.

   Specialized entry points (split alternative to `openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume()` for lazy evaluation):
   - `openpbr_prepare_volume()` → Must be called first. Derives volume properties and transmission tint; populates `OpenPBR_VolumeDerivedProps` and the volume in `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf`.
   - `openpbr_prepare_lobes()` → Must be called after `openpbr_prepare_volume()`. Sets up BSDF lobes using the derived volume properties; populates the lobes in `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf`. Can be skipped if only the volume is needed (e.g., for shadow rays).

3. **Shading API**
   - `openpbr_eval()` → Returns BSDF value (includes cosine term).
   - `openpbr_sample()` → Importance-samples a light direction; returns weight, PDF, and sampled lobe type.
   - `openpbr_pdf()` → Returns sampling PDF for a given light direction.

4. **Lobe Interface Pattern**

   GLSL has no class system, so each lobe is implemented as a plain struct paired with free functions that take the struct as their first argument. Every lobe exposes the same three function signatures:

   ```glsl
   openpbr_eval(lobe, light_direction)
   openpbr_sample(lobe, rand, light_direction, weight, pdf, sampled_type)
   openpbr_pdf(lobe, light_direction)
   ```

   The correct implementation is selected by the struct type via function overloading — compile-time polymorphism with no virtual dispatch overhead. The outermost lobe composes inward, calling the same interface on each inner lobe, so adding or replacing a lobe means implementing the same three functions for its struct type.

---

## Lookup Tables: Dual-Mode Architecture

The BSDF uses precomputed lookup tables (LUTs) for physically accurate energy compensation and fuzz/sheen lobe evaluation:

- Energy compensation tables: 7 tables for microfacet multiple scattering (ideal/opaque dielectrics, ideal metals)
- LTC table: Linearly Transformed Cosines for the fuzz/sheen lobe

These tables support two modes via the `OPENPBR_USE_TEXTURE_LUTS` compile-time switch:

### Array Mode (`OPENPBR_USE_TEXTURE_LUTS = 0`)
- Tables embedded as constant arrays in shader code
- No texture bindings needed
- Software linear/bilinear/trilinear interpolation
- Larger shader binary size
- Slower on GPU

### Texture Mode (`OPENPBR_USE_TEXTURE_LUTS = 1`)
- Tables stored as 1D/2D/3D textures
- Requires texture binding infrastructure
- Hardware-accelerated filtering and interpolation
- Smaller shader binary size
- Faster on GPU

**Array Mode is the default** because it eliminates external dependencies on texture assets and binding infrastructure.

Source data format:
- All LUT data is stored in separate header files in the `data/` directory
- Data is formatted as flattened C arrays matching the original multi-dimensional layout (e.g., `array[x][y][z]` with rightmost index contiguous)
- Users can read these files directly to populate GPU textures if needed

Implementation details:
- Energy tables: 32×32 or 32×32×32 normalized integer values [0, 65535] → [0.0, 1.0]
  - Storage type configurable via `OPENPBR_ENERGY_TABLES_USE_UINT16` (defaults to `uint` for GLSL compatibility)
- LTC table: 32×32 vec3 values
- Both modes use identical indexing and coordinate mappings for exact equivalence

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Include `openpbr.h` in your renderer (this provides the complete public API).
3. Select a shading language backend. Three backends are auto-detected from built-in compiler macros:
   - CUDA (`__CUDACC__`), MSL (`__METAL_VERSION__`), and C++ (`__cplusplus`) are detected automatically.
   - GLSL is the default fallback when none of the above macros are defined – no explicit setting needed.
   - Slang has no standard built-in detection macro, so it **requires** `OPENPBR_LANGUAGE_TARGET_SLANG=1` to be defined before including `openpbr.h`. Without it, the GLSL backend will be selected, which will likely fail to compile under the Slang compiler.

   Any backend can also be forced explicitly by setting the corresponding `OPENPBR_LANGUAGE_TARGET_CPP`, `_GLSL`, `_MSL`, `_CUDA`, or `_SLANG` flag, which overrides auto-detection.

   **C++ users** must also pre-include GLM (`<glm/glm.hpp>`) before `openpbr.h`; the interop header will emit a clear error if it is missing. See `minimal_cpp_example.cpp` for a complete working example.
4. Choose lookup table mode: Set `OPENPBR_USE_TEXTURE_LUTS` to 0 for self-contained array mode (default) or 1 for texture mode. In texture mode, `GET_2D_TEXTURE(handle)`, `GET_3D_TEXTURE(handle)`, and `GET_BINDING(name)` macros must be defined before `openpbr.h`; the headers will emit clear errors if they are missing.
5. Optional – Configure energy table storage: Set `OPENPBR_ENERGY_TABLES_USE_UINT16` to 1 for memory-efficient 16-bit storage if your shading language supports it (MSL, C++, CUDA, Slang). Defaults to 0 (`uint`) for GLSL compatibility, which does not support 16-bit integers in the core specification.
6. Optional – Fast math: Set `OPENPBR_USE_FAST_MATH_APPROXIMATIONS` to 1 to replace standard math with renderer-supplied fast approximations. You must define `openpbr_fast_rcp_sqrt`, `openpbr_fast_sqrt` (float and vec3), and `openpbr_fast_normalize` before including `openpbr.h`.
7. Populate `OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs` with texture-evaluated parameters and geometry data, or start with `openpbr_make_default_resolved_inputs()` and override specific properties.
8. Initialize the BSDF by calling `openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume()`, which returns an `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf` ready for evaluation.
9. Evaluate using `openpbr_eval()`, `openpbr_sample()`, or `openpbr_pdf()` with the prepared BSDF.
10. **Advanced:** As an alternative to `openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume()`, call `openpbr_prepare_volume()` and `openpbr_prepare_lobes()` separately in that order:
   - `openpbr_prepare_volume()` must always be called first — it sets up volume properties, thin-wall behavior, and transmission tint regardless of whether volumes are enabled.
   - `openpbr_prepare_lobes()` can then be called to prepare the BSDF lobes. It can be skipped when only the volume is needed (e.g., for shadow rays or scene-wide volume queries).

## Minimal Usage Example

```cpp
// 1. Include the entire OpenPBR BSDF
#include "openpbr.h"

// 2. Create default inputs and customize
OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs inputs = openpbr_make_default_resolved_inputs();
inputs.base_color = vec3(0.1f, 0.9f, 0.1f);  // green base color for illustration

// 3. Prepare the BSDF and volume
const OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf prepared = openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume(inputs,
                                                                      vec3(1.0f),                     // path throughput (for importance sampling)
                                                                      OpenPBR_BaseRgbWavelengths_nm,  // RGB wavelengths in nanometers
                                                                      OpenPBR_VacuumIor,              // exterior IOR
                                                                      view_direction);                // incident direction (pointing away from surface)

// 4. Sample and/or evaluate the BSDF
vec3 light_direction;
OpenPBR_DiffuseSpecular weight;
float pdf;
OpenPBR_BsdfLobeType sampled_type;
openpbr_sample(prepared,
               vec3(rand1, rand2, rand3),  // three independent uniform random numbers in [0,1)
               light_direction,            // outgoing direction
               weight,                     // BSDF * cosine / PDF
               pdf,                        // positive if sample is valid, zero otherwise
               sampled_type);              // the type of lobe that was sampled
```

### Standalone C++ example

A self-contained example is provided in `minimal_cpp_example.cpp`. It demonstrates the core path-tracing loop — prepare the BSDF, importance-sample a new direction, and accumulate the throughput weight — with a minimal random-number generator so no external dependencies are needed beyond GLM. Build instructions are at the top of the file.

## Important Usage Notes

### Coordinate Space Requirements

All directional vectors and geometric data passed to the BSDF must be in a **consistent coordinate space**:

- `view_direction` and `light_direction` must use the same coordinate system
- Typically world space, but any consistent space works (object space, tangent space, etc.)
- Shading normals and basis vectors in `OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs` must also be in this same space
- All directions point **away from the surface** (not toward it)

#### Shading Basis and Default Coordinate Frame

`OpenPBR_ResolvedInputs` contains two basis fields — `shading_basis` and `coat_basis` — that are not part of the official OpenPBR parameter specification; they are required additions that describe the local coordinate frame at the surface hit point:

- `shading_basis.t` — tangent vector
- `shading_basis.b` — bitangent vector  
- `shading_basis.n` — shading normal

The default basis returned by `openpbr_make_default_resolved_inputs()` is a z-up identity frame (tangent = X, bitangent = Y, normal = Z). This is the frame assumed throughout the implementation's internal local-space calculations.

In a real renderer, `shading_basis` and `coat_basis` can be populated with world-space vectors computed from the geometry at the ray–surface intersection, e.g.:

```cpp
inputs.shading_basis.t = world_tangent;    // from mesh UVs or procedural tangent
inputs.shading_basis.b = world_bitangent;  // derived as cross(n, t) * handedness
inputs.shading_basis.n = world_normal;     // interpolated or normal-mapped
```

As long as `view_direction`, `light_direction`, and the basis vectors are all expressed in the same space, any consistent choice of space will produce correct results.

### Distance Units

As per the OpenPBR specification, distances are assumed to be in world-space units. If different units are needed, unit conversions need to happen outside the BSDF code.

### View Direction Consistency

The `view_direction` passed to `openpbr_prepare_bsdf_and_volume()` is **cached internally** for energy compensation calculations. This means:

- **The same `view_direction` must be used** for all subsequent `openpbr_eval()`, `openpbr_sample()`, and `openpbr_pdf()` calls on that prepared BSDF
- Using a different view direction during evaluation would produce incorrect energy compensation and physically inaccurate results
- The cached view direction is stored in `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf.view_direction` and automatically used by eval/sample/pdf
- If using the split initialization path (`openpbr_prepare_volume()` + `openpbr_prepare_lobes()`), ensure you store `view_direction` in the prepared struct before calling eval/sample/pdf

### Volume Integration Boundary

The BSDF computes low-level volume properties for subsurface scattering and transmission – specifically the extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and phase function anisotropy – and exposes them as an `OpenPBR_HomogeneousVolume` in `OpenPBR_PreparedBsdf`. The actual volume integration (e.g., random walk) is left entirely to the integrator.

### Path Tracing Direction

This BSDF is designed for unidirectional path tracing from camera to lights. Bidirectional methods (photon mapping, light tracing) would require an adjoint BSDF with inverted square IOR scaling for transmission.

### Sampling Return Behavior

`openpbr_sample()` returns `void`, but indicates success/failure through the `pdf` output parameter:

- **`pdf > 0`**: Valid sample generated; `light_direction` and `weight` are set
- **`pdf == 0`**: No valid sample; output parameters are undefined
- **`pdf` is never negative**; it's always ≥ 0

Check the PDF value to determine if sampling succeeded before using the outputs.

Also note that the `weight` takes into account the entire BSDF (effectively doing MIS between all of the lobes), whereas the `sampled_type` metadata is based on the lobe that actually generated the sample (and what type of scattering event occurred).

### Diffuse/Specular Splits

The BSDF functions return BSDF values and weights in `OpenPBR_DiffuseSpecular` format, which contains diffuse and specular components that together add up to the overall value. In cases where only the overall value is needed, it can be retrieved with `openpbr_get_sum_of_diffuse_specular()`.

## Contribution and Roadmap

We welcome issues and pull requests, for example:

- Enhancements to the simple demo app (with the goal of keeping it minimal, self-contained, and readable — it illustrates how to use the BSDF API, not how to build a renderer; more complex tests belong in a separate program)
- Expanded unit tests for evaluation, sampling, and energy conservation
- Testing of the CUDA backend, which hasn't yet been used in production code

Planned or potential future work:

- Specialization constants for per-lobe feature toggles exist internally but aren't yet clearly exposed to users; more specialization constants may also be added (e.g., for thin-film and thin-wall) to cover additional lobes
- A transmission helper for translucent shadow rays exists internally but is not yet part of the public API
- Reciprocity may be traded for better energy conservation in a future version
- Implementing OpenPBR 1.2
- Continued iteration on the implementation — some naming conventions and API details may evolve as this is live production code

When contributing code, please follow the existing style: `snake_case` for names, `const` on every variable and parameter that won't be reassigned, and descriptive full-word names — no nonstandard abbreviations or single-letter variables except in tightly scoped math contexts.

Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adobe/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details and guidelines.
